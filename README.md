# Project - Weather And WeatherForeCast Web-Application

![Design preview for the Weather And WeatherForeCast Web-Application](./fullPage.png)

I made this project with the help of HTML Css JavaScript and WeatherApi. By Default its location  is Delhi. You can search any place what you want in the given search box.
if your place is found then it display it's current weather details and next 6 day's weather forecast details. 

If your place is not found then it gives an error msg and the previous searched place weather details shows on the web page.
